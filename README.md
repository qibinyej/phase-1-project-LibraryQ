LibraryQ has a collection of children's picture books. 

As the page first loads, it displays the first book with its cover image, title, and author.

You can click on each book to view their information. 

On the bottom of the webpage, there are an upvote button and a review box where patrons can submit reviews.

Happy Reading!
